### Supermarket Software for Billing, Inventory and Customer Facilitation

*Tech Stack: Python (Library: Pandas), MySQL*

- Supermarket Software which enables staff (after authentication check using the linked database) to generate bills efficiently and to view and edit stock details, all of which is maintained in the database.
- Customers can use the software to access all sorts of information about the store, products, deals and discounts using the software and can register themselves as ’Members’ to avail additional perks.

This is a basic software and doesn't employ dedicated frontend and runs as a python program. However, a connection to MySQL database is used for permanent record storage and updation. I built this for my CBSE subject Informatics Practices in Class XII.

#### Running the code:
*Requirements: Python (with libraries: pandas, mysql-connector-python, numpy, matplotlib, sys), MySQL DBMS*

- For database setup, run the commands from `db_setup.sql`. This file contains additional commands to describe schema structure etc. which are not mandatory for set-up, but can be run for a better idea of the database.
- Add your password for mysql connection to `champak.py` and run the script. The program will run on command-line.

#### About the report:
`Project-Report.pdf` contains the screenshots of setting up the mysql database, as well as program in action, along with more details on the project (which could actually be unnecessary hehe :))
